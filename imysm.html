<h1>Dear Yasrounti,

I find myself reaching out, compelled to express what's been on my mind. I miss you â€” miss everything about you. Your voice, your beautiful smile, and especially you in my life. I understand that reaching out like this may seem unusual after everything that has happened. I believe you're living your life, perhaps moving forward, but I wanted you to know that I never stopped thinking about you.

I still cherish the sound of your voice, your beautiful smile that could brighten the darkest days. I take the long way home from work, hoping to catch a glimpse of you, even from a distance. It might sound a bit silly, but it brings a sense of comfort, as if I'm still connected to you.

As this year comes to a close, I want to express my gratitude for everything. I genuinely appreciate the time we spent together. You'll always hold a special place in my heart, and I find myself praying for you every day. I wish you health and wealth in the upcoming year. May all your dreams come true, and may you find happiness that lasts a lifetime.

I've always wished for our relationship to succeed, and I prayed for it. Life, however, doesn't always align with our desires. I want you to know that you were more than enough for me, and I tried my best to make things better for us. Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. I hope these words don't bring tears but rather offer a sense of understanding and closure.

Lastly, good luck with your exams. I have full confidence that you'll excel. Don't stress too much; you've got this.

Wishing you all the best,
doudi</h1>
